Don't open, data inside

## What it's walking distance?
"Walking distance" is defined as the distance that can be travelled by walking in a reasonable amount of time. 

In this project, we analyse this distance within any neighbourhood from Natal, Brazil. Thus, we are able to evaluate the pedestrian accessibility at the city.

## Analysis

This is a recent version of the project made in 2019 available in this [repository](https://github.com/nymarya/the-walking-distance) and described in Portuguese in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@mayradazevedo/ate-onde-e-posivel-chegar-a-pe-em-natal-4e50d1e46685).
